2,1,1,2,There is some trouble brewing down by the docks. Go help my brother fend off these bandits.
3,2,1,1,Have you seen my dog? I've looked everywhere for him.
4,3,1,1,I need to ask of you a favour young hero.
5,3,1,2,The bandit leader Oshun has stolen my prized cow. Without her I will never win the country fair.

7,3,2,1,Thank you so much. Here; some coin for your time
8,4,1,1,Wha'cha looking at scrub?
9,5,1,1,My name was Suha.
10,5,1,2,I was 25 years old.
11,5,1,3,I killed my husband.
12,5,1,4,I was hung two days later.
13,5,1,5,I don't regret a thing.
14,6,1,1,I wasn't born in the palace.
15,6,1,2,I was born in a small place far away.
16,6,1,3,I can't remember the name anymore.
17,6,1,4,I was 11 years old when they came.
18,6,1,5,I never saw my family again.
19,7,1,1,This was a great hall.
20,7,1,2,Many great men came here.
21,7,1,3,I was told the things they discussed were important.
22,7,1,4,Servants of all kinds bustled and worked here. Fighting to please the important men.
23,7,1,5,"They labored away their precious hours. Each day, another tick of their life."
24,7,1,6,Why did they do this to themselves? Were they forced to? What did the important men mean to them?
25,7,1,7,"I remember once, I watched a woman have a seizure in this hall. She collapsed to the floor."
26,7,1,8,It tooks 12 minutes for somebody to aid her. She died a few minutes later.
27,7,1,9,I did nothing.
28,8,1,1,This was the family room. Where children and relatives of the palace lounged.
29,8,1,2,Servants would rear and nurture children here. 
29.5,8,1,3,My children were raised here.
30,8,1,4,The sounds of laughter filled the long hallway.

34,9,1,3,"If the food was not deemed worthy of the palace, it was disgarded."
35,9,1,4,"Out there, somewhere, I knew my family starved."
36,10,1,1,This was the bathhouse. 
37,10,1,2,Men and women of all classes would wash away their filth.
38,10,1,3,The important men refused to bathe at the same time as their servants.
39,10,1,4,The important men bathed for long times.
40,10,1,5,"But, What sort of filth do important men have to wash away?"
41,10,1,6,Not the kind that a bath can fix.
42,11,1,1,I remember the sermons given here.
43,11,1,2,We were told that everything is how it was supposed to be.
44,11,1,3,This confounded me. How could a kind God let men starve?
45,11,1,4,How could a cruel God allow joy?
46,11,1,5,How could any God accept something else as divine?
47,11,1,6,Kings are not divine.
